#description: "The intermediate steps of an interactive rebase are done with a detached HEAD (partially to avoid polluting the active branchâ€™s reflog). If you finish the full rebase operation, it will update your original branch with the cumulative result of the rebase operation and reattach HEAD to the original branch."
